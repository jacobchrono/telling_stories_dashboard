## Telling Stories with Data Dashboard
#### Jacob Clement

### Inital submission
The final product for my first submission is `scripts\price_mileage_6.py`.

I scraped `state` from craigslist and was almost done with the process so I figured I would submit what I have and try to work with the data for Montana to create a final polished product.

Here is a static view of my car, I stopped filtering as the sample is small. My goal is to include a version of this dynamic scatterplot in my final dashboard.

### Second Submission

You should use `html\dynamic_scatter_fail.html` for future examples of bad graphs. ChatGPT defended its output but I could not attach the full convertsation due to a pasted image.

My vision is to add a widget here the user can build a custom regression model of the full data. I had to limit the number of filters for file size and ability to share so my idea my not be within the scope of the project. Can we share a hosted version over the message board? The final product for this submission is `html\vehicle_dashboard.html`. The relevant python script is `scripts\combine_montana_4.py.`
